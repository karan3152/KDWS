Document Placeholder Image

To complete the document viewer functionality, please add a placeholder image named "document-placeholder.png" in this directory.

The placeholder image should be:
1. A simple, generic document icon or image
2. Approximately 200x200 pixels in size
3. PNG format with a transparent background

This placeholder will be displayed when a document image fails to load or cannot be found.

You can create a simple placeholder image using any image editing software, or download a free document icon from sites like:
- https://www.flaticon.com/
- https://www.iconfinder.com/
- https://www.freepik.com/

After adding the placeholder image, the document viewer will automatically use it as a fallback when needed.
